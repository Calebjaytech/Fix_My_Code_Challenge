# Fix My Code Challenge
  Fix my code is a new type of project, where we'll jump into an existing code 
base and fix it!

This was a project provided by ALX in which We were challenged with debugging 
various programs. The challenges spanned a variety of programming languages 
from C to Python to Javascript to Ruby and more, some of which I was familiar 
with, others of which I was not.
